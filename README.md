### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bas Buijsen and i am currently a software engineering student at Avans Breda.
<br/>

I worked on a few different projects. I am mainly focussed on iOS mobile development. I created ShareMyCar and BRESS iOS apps and i am currently working on Praktijk Hoogbegaafd iOS. For these application i also created backends. I mostly work with .NET 6 for the backends but I am sufficiently skilled with node.js. If there are any questions about me or what I do you can always contact me with the information below. (Because of security or work in progress some repositories may be private)
